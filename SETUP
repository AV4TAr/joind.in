You'll need to do a few things to set up the environment 
for this code:

- Create a webserver writable directory in system/cache
called "ctokens"

- In the system/application/config directory do:
  > Make a database.php file using the database.php.dist as a guide
  > Make a config.php file using the config.php.dist as a guide

Grab the curr_db.sql file and drop it into your database 
and you should be good to go!
